Cassava - an important crop that is cultivated in the tropics - is affected by several pests
and infections every year. The task was to identify and classify the leaves into five main
classes: Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD), Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB), Cassava Green
Mottle (CGM)), Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD and a healthy specimen. Since
EfficientNet was the new buzzword (proven to perform better than current CNNs), we decided to
implement it. Therefore we developed a deep CNN model implementing EfficientNet-B3 that
makes use of the compound coefficient method, a different scaling approach prescribed for
EfficientNet, to scale up the model in a more structured way. This approach thus avoids brute
force manual tuning and stagnating performance issues. We used data augmentation
techniques to improve the generalisability of the model. The model did not overfit the dataset
and it achieved an overall accuracy of 96.74%. Higher versions of EfficientNet architecture were
not preferred because the accuracy had saturated with B3 architecture.
